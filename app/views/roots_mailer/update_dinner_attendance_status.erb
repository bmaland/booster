Hi <%= @name %>,

The official conference dinner will be held at Kalfaret Brygghus, May 23. The address is Kalfarveien 76, and we will walk there (or provide other transportation if the weather is horrible) together after the open spaces end at 19:00. The dinner starts with welcome drinks at 19:30, and the dinner itself starts at 20:00. There will be entertainment sometime during the evening, and the dress code is non-existent.

The dinner is free for everyone at the conference, and we would like all of you to attend. However, we understand that some people won't be able to make it for different reasons. Because this constitutes a significant expense, we would very much appreciate it if you update your registration for the dinner.
