Hi <%= @name %>,

The Roots conference is soon approaching and we are hard at work putting the program together. We have invited several interesting speakers that we know will bring new thought-provoking ideas to Roots. Check them out on http://rootsconf.no/speakers. We have already received quite a few good proposals for tutorials and lightning talks in response to our Call for Papers (see http://rootsconf.no/talks). However, we are still looking for more proposals.

As a previous contributor at Roots we particularly ask you to consider sending a proposal for this years conference. Submit a topic with abstract about any (IT-related) topic you really care about! Your audience will probably be developers, architects, testers/test managers and/or project managers, but you will not have to cater to all audiences at once. Go to http://rootsconf.no/info/cfp and register the topic and abstract for a lightning talk or a tutorial. A lightning talk is a presentation of 5 minutes, while a tutorial can be 1 ½ hour or half a day.

If you're not planning on contributing this year but still want to participate, the Early Bird deadline is February 22. We would love to see you again!

Deadlines
CFP for tutorials will close March 11th 2012!
CFP for lightning talks will close March 25th 2012!
Roots 2012: April 25–27!


We are looking forward to your contributions,

The Roots committee
