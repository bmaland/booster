Dear <%= @user.name %>,

We would like to inform you of two things: Hotel booking and the program.

First of all: The program is out (with a couple of TBA's), and you can see it at http://www.rootsconf.no/program
Tell your friends!

Secondly, if you're not from Bergen, are planning to stay at the conference hotel and haven't booked a room yet, we
suggest that you do this very soon. The conference hotel will let go of the rooms they've been holding for us after
Friday (tomorrow).

To book a room at the conference hotel, contact the hotel by phone (+47 55 30 90 80) or e-mail
bergencity@scandichotels.com. Booking code is 'ROOTS'. The special rate for Roots participants is NOK 1290 for a
single room, and NOK 1490 for a double room. This rate is not available on the Scandic hotels website.

If you haven't paid for your ticket yet: Please do so immediately or tell us if you've changed your mind and won't
be attending anyway, since we're running out of tickets.

We're looking forward to seeing you at the conference!

The Roots 2011 committee
