Hi, <%= @speaker.name %>

We regret to inform you that your presentation
    "<%= @talk.title %>"
for Roots 2012 has not been accepted. We received a lot of great
abstracts this year, and unfortunately we do not have room for all of
them.

If all your abstracts have been refused, we hope that you still want to
attend the conference. In that case, we will convert your registration
to a regular registration. The ticket price at the time of your
registration applies. If you still want to attend, please go to
<%= @current_user_url %> and pay for the ticket.

If you do not want to participate, please let us know by replying to
this email, and we will delete your registration.

Best regards,
The Roots 2012 committee
