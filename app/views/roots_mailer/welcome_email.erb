Hello <%= @user.name %>,

Roots 2012 starts in only a few days. Here is some important
information you will need. Key points:

 - Bring your laptop to Roots
 - Some tutorials require some pre-installed software
 - Please update your dinner reservation


LOCATION AND TRANSPORT

As usual, Roots 2012 takes place at the Scandic Bergen City Hotel.
You can get there by airport bus, taxi, bus/light rail or car. The
closest bus stop is at Olav Kyrres gate, and the closest light rail
stop and airport bus is at Festplassen. The best place to park your
car is the the parking house Klostergarasjen. We will encourage you to
use public transportation, if possible. You can find a map with key
locations here: http://bit.ly/roots2012-map


LAPTOPS

Roots 2012 has a lot of hands-on tutorials, so we recommend everyone
to bring a laptop if possible, in order to get the most out of the
different tutorials. In order to minimize startup time, some tutorial
speakers prefer that you have some piece of software installed before
the tutorial starts. Please read the abstracts of the tutorials you
plan to attend carefully.

If you don't have a laptop, don't despair. We encourage pairing with
others to maximize learning for both of you.


REGISTRATION

Registration opens at 08:00 Wednesday morning, and the conference itself
starts at 09:00. To avoid standing in a queue when you could be
talking to interesting people and drinking awesome coffee, come early.
Please note that we will not send out any physical tickets in advance -
you will recieve your name badge at the registration.


CONFERENCE DINNER

The conference dinner will be at Sardinen USF, Verftet (see the map:
http://bit.ly/roots2012-map). It will feature a tapas buffet,
drinks and entertainment by the local band Pink Robots. We start with
an ap√©ritif Wednesday at 19:00, and the dinner is served at 19:30. We
expect this to be the party of the year! The band will be on stage at 21:30.

Please log in at http://rootsconf.no/users/current and tell us if
you're attending the dinner or not, so we know how many people to expect.
The conference dinner is included in the ticket price, so there's no
reason not to attend :)
