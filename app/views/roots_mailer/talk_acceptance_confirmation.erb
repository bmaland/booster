Hello, <%= @speaker.name %>

We have the pleasure of informing you that your abstract
     "<%= @talk.title %>"
for Booster 2013 has been accepted!

We would like you to confirm that you are still able to present at the
conference. Please do so by replying to this email as soon as possible,
and before April 4, so that we can publish the conference program.
<% if @talk.is_tutorial? %>
There are a few practical details we need you to attend to:

 - If there is a limit on the number of people who can attend your
   session, please edit your talk by following the below link and
   entering the maximum number of participants. Please do not set the
   limit below 24.

   Edit your talk: <%= edit_talk_url(@talk, :host => "boosterconf.no") %>

 - If you are unable to attend the conference one or more of the days,
   you must inform us by email so that we can schedule your session
   accordingly.

You are entitled to free entrance to the conference and conference
dinner.
<% end %>
<% if @talk.is_lightning_talk? %>
The lightning talks are scheduled for Wednesday April 25.
<% end %>
<% if not @speaker.has_accepted_tutorial? %>
Because you have an accepted talk, you are entitled to a discounted
ticket price, but you still need to buy a ticket. Please do so as soon
as possible by going to <%= @current_user_url %> and go to payment from
there. You have to log in first, using the email address and password
you provided at registration time.

If you have already paid for a normal ticket, the difference between the
discounted ticket price and price you paid will be refunded.
<% end %>
<% if not @speaker.invited? %>
Please note that we will not cover travel and lodging.

If you need a hotel room in Bergen, we recommend the conference hotel,
Scandic Bergen City. Please contact them by telephone +47 55 30 90 80
or by email at bergencity@scandichotels.com and give the booking code

<% end %>
If you are not able to present at the conference after all, please let
us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, so we can offer
this time slot to someone else.

If you want to make any changes to the description of your talk, it is
still possible to do so until the conference starts. However, please be
aware that we will publish the program on our web pages in a few days.
