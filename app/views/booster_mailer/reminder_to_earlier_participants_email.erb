Hi <%= @name %>,

As a participant at last yearâ€™s Roots conference, we would like to remind you that the deadline for signing up as an early bird for Booster 2013 is right around the corner. So if you haven't done so already, hurry up! If you register by February 22, the price is only NOK 6250,- for the whole three day conference (including VAT).

We continue our focus on hands-on tutorials, from where you can take home knowledge you can use straight away. Among confirmed speakers are Kevlin Henney, Matt Barcomb, Mike Lee, Linda Rising, Rinat Abdoullin and Olaf Lewitz.

We have also received quite a few good proposals for tutorials and lightning talks in response to our Call for Papers (see http://www.boosterconf.no/talks). However, we are still looking for more proposals. Send a topic with abstract about any (IT-related) topic you really care about! Your audience will probably be developers, architects, testers/test managers and/or project managers, but you will not have to cater to all audiences at once. Go to http://rootsconf.no/info/cfp and register the topic and abstract for a lightning talk or a tutorial.

Important dates
22 February	Early-bird deadline
11 March	CfP deadline for tutorials
23 March	CfP deadline for lightning talks
25-27 April	 Roots 2012
