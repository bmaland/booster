<p>Hi <%= @name %>,</p>

<p>The Booster conference is soon approaching and we are hard at work putting the program together. We have invited
  several interesting speakers that we know will bring new thought-provoking ideas to Booster. Check them out on
  http://boosterconf.no/speakers. We have already received quite a few good proposals for tutorials and lightning talks
  in response to our Call for Papers (see http://boosterconf.no/talks). However, we are still looking for more
  proposals.</p>

<p>As a previous contributor at Booster we particularly ask you to consider sending a proposal for this years
  conference. Submit a topic with abstract about any (IT-related) topic you really care about! Your audience will
  probably be developers, architects, testers/test managers and/or project managers, but you will not have to cater to
  all audiences at once. Go to http://boosterconf.no/info/cfp and register the topic and abstract for a lightning talk
  or a tutorial. A lightning talk is a presentation of 5 minutes, while a tutorial can be 1 ½ hour or half a day.</p>

<p>If you're not planning on contributing this year but still want to participate, the Early Bird deadline is January
  15. We would love to see you again!</p>

<p>Deadlines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CFP for tutorials will close January 21st <%= Dates::CONFERENCE_YEAR %>!</li>
  <li>CFP for lightning talks will close January 28th <%= Dates::CONFERENCE_YEAR %>!</li>
  <li>Booster <%= Dates::CONFERENCE_YEAR %>: March 11–13!</li>
</ul>

<p>We are looking forward to your contributions,</p>

<p>The Booster organizers</p>
