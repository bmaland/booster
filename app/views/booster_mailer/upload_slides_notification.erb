Hi <%= @speaker %>,

It's less than one week until Booster 2015 begins, and we hope you are well underway with the preparations for your presentation.

As the lightning talk format that we are able to switch from one speaker to the next in a swift manner, we would like to have the slides on one common computer 24 hours before the start of the conference. Because of this, we kindly ask you to submit your slides to us no later than Sunday May 22. 13:30.

This year we will support slides in Open Office, Microsoft Office and PDF format. You can upload the slides for your presentation at <%= @edit_talk_url %>. If you're not planning on using slides or have any special needs, please let us know by sending an email to kontakt@boosterconf.no.

To upload the slides, you must log in using the email address you used when you registered (<%= @speaker_email %>). In case you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by going to <%= @new_password_reset_url %>.
