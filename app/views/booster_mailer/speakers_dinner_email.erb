<p>Dear <%= @user %>,</p>
<p>
The conference is soon approaching, and we are looking forward to seeing you all in Bergen. Here is some practical information that you might need.
</p>

<p>
First off; the social events. We encourage you to participate if you have the possibility. On the wednesday there
will be a conference dinner at the restaurant BÃ¸lgen & Moi, http://www.bolgenogmoi.no/Restaurant/Bergen. After dinner
there will be a live performance by the local band, Ocean of Lotion, http://www.oceanoflotion.com/. On thursday evening
there will be a Speaker's Dinner, at the newly opened Litteraturhuset, http://www.litthusbergen.no/servering/. After
the Speaker's Dinner we hope you would like to join the local .Net User Group's fishbowl event, one floor up from the
dinner.

After the conference is over, on Friday evening, we will throw an after party at one of the organizers. This is a good
  opportunity to unwind and  hang out with the other speakers and the committee.
      <% end %>
</p>

<p>
We need to know which of these events you would like to attend, so please reply to this email and let us know. Also,
  if you have any food allergies or other special needs foodwise, please let us know about that, too.
  <p>

    <p>
Secondly; locations: <br/>
All events are located in the centre of Bergen, within walking distance of the hotel. <%=  link_to 'Here is a map',

<p>
If you have any other questions, or if there is anything you need to tell us, please let us know, and we will get
