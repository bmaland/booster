<p>Hello, <%= @speaker.first_name %></p>

<p>We have the pleasure of informing you that your abstract
  "<%= @talk.title %>"
  for Booster 2015 has been accepted!</p>

<p>We would like you to confirm that you are still able to present at the
  conference, and that your assigned slot works with your schedule. 
  Please do so by replying to this email as soon as possible,
  and before February 24th, so that we can publish the conference program. </p>

<% if @talk.is_tutorial? %>
    <p>There are a few practical details we need you to attend to:</p>
 <p>
        You have been assigned a date and time for your workshop, which you can find in 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsSmC89I-7PrdDNJRVpOMC1sTmEzSE5HUWhDM3FDdlE&usp=sharing">
    this google spreadsheet.
  </a> </p>
    <p>
      It is still possible to edit your talk by using this url: <%= edit_talk_url(@talk, :host => "boosterconf.no") %>
    </p>

    <p>You are entitled to free entrance to the conference and conference
      dinner.</p>
<% end %>
<% if @talk.is_lightning_talk? %>
    <p>The lightning talks are scheduled for Wednesday March 11.</p>
<% end %>
<% unless @speaker.has_accepted_tutorial? %>
    <p>Because you have an accepted talk, you are entitled to a discounted
      ticket price, but you still need to buy a ticket. Please do so as soon
      as possible by going to <%= @current_user_url %> and go to payment from
      there. You have to log in first, using the email address and password
      you provided at registration time.</p>

    <p>If you have already paid for a normal ticket, the difference between the
      discounted ticket price and the price you paid will be refunded.</p>
<% end %>
<% unless @speaker.invited? %>
    <p>Please note that we will not normally cover travel and lodging. However, we will make an exception in some cases. Confer with our <a href="http://www.boosterconf.no/info/monetary_policy">monetary policy</a> for the details, and contact us on kontakt@boosterconf.no if you think you are eligible. If you need a hotel room in Bergen, we recommend the
      conference hotel,
      Scandic Bergen City. Please contact them by telephone +47 55 30 90 80
      or by email at bergencity@scandichotels.com.</p>
<% end %>
<p>If you are not able to present at the conference after all, please let
  us know as soon as possible by replying to this email, so we can offer
  this time slot to someone else.</p>

<p>If you want to make any changes to the description of your talk, it is
  still possible to do so until the conference starts. However, please be
  aware that we will begin publishing information about the program in a few days.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>
The Booster conference organizers</p>
