Hello <%= @user.name %>,

We would like to inform you that tutorial registration opens Friday May 20 09:00 AM (local time, UTC +01:00). This is
done so that you will be able to know in advance which tutorials you will be able to attend, as some tutorials have
a limited number of participants it is able to accommodate. The tutorial registration will be done on a
first-come-first-served-basis, so we advise you to register early, as we expect some tutorials to be very popular.

You can register for tutorials by following this link: http://boosterconf.no/tutorial_registration (opens Friday). This
requires login with the email address you registered with (<%= @user.email %>) and the password you provided when you
registered. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by using this url: <%= @lost_password_url %>
