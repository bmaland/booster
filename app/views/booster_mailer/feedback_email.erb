<body>Hello <%= @talk.speaker_name %>,

<p>As you may have registered, we had feedback from the participants at Booster 2013. This year, we had such a
  differenciated feedback system, that we feel that we may give our participants valuable information that they may use
  in future presentations. The participants could give each presentation a grade with one of five different smileys,
  from "very sour" to "very happy". We have in the average numbers below translated the smileys into a table based scale
  from 1-5, where 1 represents "very sour" and 5 represents "very happy".</p>

<p>Your presentation received a total of <%= @talk.num_of_votes %> feedbacks. The average of the feedback you got
  was <%= @talk.average_feedback_score %>. To give you an impression of how you stand relative to the others, we have
  split the presentations in four categories, based on the average feedback.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gruppe 1: xx% with the highest average on their feedback (over 86. percentil)</li>
  <li>Gruppe 2: xx% with second highest average on their feedback (between 70. and 86. percentil)</li>
  <li>Gruppe 3: xx% with second lowest average on their feedback (between 40. and 70. percentil)</li>
  <li>Gruppe 4: xx% with lowest average on their feedback (under 40. percentil)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your presentation ended up in group <%= @group %>.</p>

<% if @talk.feedback_comments %>
    <p>You also received the following comments from those who attended your presentation:</p>
    <ul>
      <% @talk.feedback_comments.each do %>
          <li><%= comment.comment %></li>
      <% end %></ul>
<% end %>

<p>We had an extremely high quality on the presentations this year, something the feedback reflects. The feedback from
  the
  participants is valuable information you can take advantage of to be able to improve. Use them! Comments and scores
  are
  not published. They are for you alone.</p>

<p>We hope that you will submit a proposal for a lightning talk next year too!</p>

<p>With greetings from <br>
  The Booster 2013 organizing committee</p>

<p style="color: gray;">Disclaimer: Average numbers, particularly on such a small data sample as ours, is but an
  indication of the quality of
  your presentation, at best. In our survey, we did not distinguish between the quality of the content and the quality
  of
  the way that the topic was presented. Neither have we taken into consideration the outliers, the difference between
  the
  average feedback between the conference days or the difference between the average feedback from
  the
  25% with the lowest number of feedback vs the rest. Additionally, an average value assumes that a
  number 4 feedback ("happy smiley") is twice as good as a 2 response ("sour smiley"), something that is not necessarily
  true for those who have given the feedback. As a conclusion, this is an indication, and not the whole truth!</p>
