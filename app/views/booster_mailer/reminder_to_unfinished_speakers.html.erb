<p>Hi <%= @name %>,</p>

<p>
  We can see that you signed up as a speaker at the Boosterconf web page. However, you never sent in a proposal.
  The good news is: It's still possible to do so for you! You have until Sunday 29. November to send in a proposal
  - after that, Call for Presentations is really closed. You can send in your proposal <%= link_to "here", info_cfp_url %>.
</p>
<p>
  We hope to see your proposal!
</p>

<p>
  Best regards,<br>
  The Booster conference organizers<br>
