  <h2 class="header-join">What is Booster?</h2>

  <p>The Booster conference is an IT conference for the whole development team, and will take place <%= Dates::CONFERENCE_DATES %> in
    Bergen, Norway.
    Squeezed in between the mountains of western Norway and the fjords, the location provides for a unique experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Booster is a software conference aimed at developers, project managers/scrum masters, architects, UX people,
    testers, test managers and security professionals.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don&#8217;t do the traditional hour-long lectures. Instead we have the bite-sized wisdom of lightning talks and
    the immersion of tutorials, making you come back from the conference with real knowledge you can use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meeting other people is a large part of what makes a conference worth attending. At Booster we want to make it easy
    to chat with other participants and speakers. That&#8217;s why we have long breaks, provide excellent coffee and
    good food, and a conference dinner included in the price. We also invite local user communities to take part in the
    conference. Speakers are encouraged to hang around during breaks, and participate at the conference dinner and
    community events.

  <h2>Why is the Booster conference different?
    <%= image_tag("maskott3.png", {:width => "120px", :class => "pull-right"}) %>
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>We're in Bergen</strong>, the most beautiful city in Norway.</li>
    <li><strong>We believe that lack of communication is one of the industry's biggest problems.</strong> We aim to
      gather
      developers, project managers/scrum masters, architects, UX people, testers, test managers and security
      professionals in one conference.
    </li>
    <li><strong>We don't have any hour-long talks</strong>. Instead we have the bite-sized wisdom of lightning talks and
      the immersion of tutorials, making you come back from the conference with real knowledge you can use.
    </li>
    <li><strong>We care about the social aspects, too.</strong> The most interesting parts of a conference often happen
      in the breaks. That's why we have top notch food, long breaks, a conference dinner included in the price, a high
      speaker-participant ratio and friendly speakers that are happy to talk with the participants.
    </li>
  </ul>
